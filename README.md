## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

I am a student at a high school in Karuizawa. Me and a half of my grade take Computer Science as a subject in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. We often times have to share code in class and especially outside of class. We used to rely on platforms like Google Chat and Messenger to copy and paste short pieces of code at a time. It was not a very organised and effective solution as it made crediting code hard. Not to mention, sharing code over chat platforms make it very hard to add description to the code without making the chat very long and inlegible for looking back. Everyone posts their code in the community as well which makes it hard for other users to differentiate between good, working code and code that needs fixing. As such, there was a need for an consolidated solution for everyone in my class to share code and the class decided on a social media styled website that could represent code with correct syntax formatting and indentations shown.(See evidence of consultation in Appendix 1)

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution would be social-media styled website that can store data inside a database. The most common tools for web development are Javascript, HTML, CSS[^8]but Javascript is a client-side language, which means that code is executed on the user's browser. This can make it vulnerable to attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS). To remedy this, Python would be an adequate programming language for that as it is not a client-side language, open sourced, mature and excells at memory management[^2]. To host the webiste, Flask would be an adequate choice as it is highly scalable, making it fit to the client's need for a school use website without overcomplicating resources[^3].For the database, SQLite would be a good fit as the data we are fitting is not very large in number and SQLite, with its embedded,serverless nature[^4], can reduce the use of computing resources while running the website, not to mention higher speeds. To interface with the SQLAlchemy is the choice to go as it has improved performance and is protected against security attacks[^5]. As for the user interface for the website, Bootstrap 5 is recommended for its dynamic scaling abilites to scale automatically for different devices[^6].To keep the website and their users secure, JSON web tokens are used because they are resistant to security attacks[^7] and can prevent malicious users from modifying the key to access unauthorized content.
