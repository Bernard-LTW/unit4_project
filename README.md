## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

I am a student at a high school in Karuizawa. I and a half of my grade take Computer Science as a subject in the International Baccalaureate. We often times have to share code in class and especially outside of class. We used to rely on platforms like Google Chat and Messenger to copy and paste short pieces of code at a time. It was not a very organised and effective solution as it made crediting code hard and referencing back to older shared code basically impossible. As such, there was a need for an consolidated solution for everyone in my class to share code and the class decided on a social media styled website that could represent code with correct syntax formatting and indentations shown.

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution would include a localized computer program with a GUI(
Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Python would be an adequate programming language for the
solution as it is open source, it is mature and supported in multiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS,
Windows, Linux.[^2]For the database, SQLite would be an adequate solution as it is an embedded, serverless relational
database which means the program and the database can be both localized.[^3]To interface with the SQLite database,
SQLAlchemy is the choice to go as it support ORM(Object Relational Mapper). An ORM is a database abstraction layer that
sits as an intermediary between the code and the database engine[^4], which simple queries and makes the code more
concise. As for the GUI, KivyMD is chosen for its elegant and simpleness. This GUI framework uses is structured in
object-oriented format and makes the development easy[^5]
